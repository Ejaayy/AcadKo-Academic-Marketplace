### üõ† Tech Stack

The application uses Python and Flask as the backend framework to handle web routing, sessions, and database interaction. The frontend utilizes HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for responsive, accessible UI design. SQLite serves as a lightweight local database for managing users, service posts, and other data. Flask sessions track login status and user activity, while Jinja2 powers dynamic HTML templates.

### üìÅ Database Design

AcadKo‚Äôs database is designed with simplicity and scalability in mind. Key tables include:

- **users**: stores user information such as username, email, password hash, profile description, and optional fields like LinkedIn URL, skills, certifications, and experience.
- **posts**: represents service listings with fields for user_id (linking to the poster), service_title, description, category, price, and timestamps.
- Future tables may include messaging, order tracking, and coin balance for an internal currency system.

This structure allows for fast queries, easy user management, and simple integration of future features.

### üîê Security & Privacy

Security is a key priority for AcadKo. Passwords are securely hashed using `werkzeug.security` methods before storage. User sessions are managed carefully to prevent unauthorized access. Input sanitization and parameterized SQL queries protect against injection attacks. The platform respects user privacy and does not share personal data without consent.
